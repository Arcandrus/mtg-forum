# User Stories
When deciding on what I wanted to add to this project I looked at several soical media and forum style websites and took the greatest amount of inspiration from Reddit. To this effect, I wrote my user stories based on what I considered the cornerstone features of such a platform and split them into two Epics, User Profile and Content Interaction, detailed below.
